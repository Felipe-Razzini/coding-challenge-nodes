# Coding Challenge - Nodes

This is a simple application that visualizes hierarchical data as a tree using D3.js, Vue.js and Express.js.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: This project was developed with Node.js version 16.15.1. You can check if you have Node.js installed, and which version, by running `node -v` in your terminal. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can find instructions for installing it on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm (Node Package Manager): This comes bundled with Node.js. You can check if you have npm installed by running `npm -v` in your terminal.
- Vue CLI (Optional): If you need to serve the application or perform other tasks that require Vue CLI, you can check if you have it installed by running `vue --version` in your terminal. If you don't have Vue CLI installed, you can install it by running `npm install -g @vue/cli`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Felipe-Razzini/coding-challenge-nodes.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd coding-challenge-nodes`
3. Install the required packages: `npm install`

## Usage
1. Start the Express.js server: npm run dev
2. Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:<port>`
Replace `<port>` with the port number your Express.js server is running on.
3. Once the tree visualization is loaded, you can interact with it by clicking on the nodes. Clicking on a node will display a popup with its description.

## Testing
1. This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.
2. The file `server.test.js` contains a test for the server /data route. It uses supertest to make requests to the server and check the responses.
3. To run the tests, use `npm test`.
